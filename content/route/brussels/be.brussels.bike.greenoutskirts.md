## Let's go !

Playgrounds, a mini steam train and numerous parks: this cycling route is fun for the whole family! ðŸ‘©

## Practical

Cycle your way through the Royal Domain of Laeken, take in the green views of Watermael-Boitsfort and take a walk around the ponds near the RSC Anderlecht stadium.

Thirsty or hungry from all that pedaling? No worries, you pass plenty of cafÃ©s and restaurants on the way.

Happy biking!
