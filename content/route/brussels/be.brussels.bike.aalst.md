## Let's go !

Onions, carnival and Bockie De Repper sum up the destination of our next cycling route.

## Practical

Always wanted to visit those lovely people living near the Dender? Letâ€™s roll!

On the way, you pass Waalborre park and the Hopduvel on the market square in Asse. Cycle into Aalst from the Faluintjes region, where you can spot hop fields in Meldert. From Aalst, follow the delightful towpath along the Dender to Denderleeuw, to reach Brussels again over the gentle slopes of northern Pajottenland.

Have fun in Aalst!
