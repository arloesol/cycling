## Let's go !

This time we head north towards Londerzeel. At junction 56, take in the magnificent views of Brussels. And here’s a tip for plant enthusiasts: spend a few hours at the Meise Botanic Garden.

## Practical

If you aren’t a great fan of plants, this route also passes the Palm and Mort Subite breweries, as well as the Atomium. In other words, this 52 km route has something for everyone!
