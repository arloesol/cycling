## Let's go !

We’ll start at the busy Hermann-Debroux metro stop. But don’t be fooled. This cycle route will transport you to the lush nature to the southeast of our capital in a heartbeat!

## Practical

You’ll pass the park of Tervuren, as well as the Brussels parks of Tournay-Solvay, Seny, Ten Reuken and the Jan van Ruusbroeck Park, home to the Castle of Hoeilaart (at junction 42). And, if you’re a bit saddle sore, you can stretch your legs at the Groenendaal Hippodrome or the Arboretum of Tervuren, or you could integrate a cultural visit to Folon Foundation in the grounds of Solvay Castle into your ride. Here, you’ll discover more than 500 water colours, sketches, paintings and sculptures created by contemporary Belgian artist Jean-Michel Folon. Looking for the ideal location for a picnic? There are numerous idyllic spots to be found along the lake of Genval.
