## Let's Go!

Starting at Herkenrode Abbey, this cycle route leads you round the pond landscape of De Wijers. Discover a green oasis of calm, and a variety of heritage and art along the way. The ponds were originally designed for fish farming by order of Herkenrode Abbey, and the Zonhoven fish farms remain operational to this day. The coal track takes you through De Teut-Ten Haagdoorn Nature Reserve before descending towards ‘Cycling through Water’ in Bokrijk. From there, ride back towards Hasselt, where street art brightens up the streetscape.

Welcome to De Zwaan, the former village pub in the cozy Godsheide (Hasselt) has been transformed into a brasserie full of character. The old part has the atmosphere of a brown pub, while the orangery invites you to dine in style (score of 13 in the Gault-Millau). Fresh ingredients, carefully selected wines, a friendly service in a cozy interior make you feel right at home.
