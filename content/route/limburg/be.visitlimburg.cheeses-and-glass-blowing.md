## Let's Go!

A flat route in the most northerly corner of Limburg. Through forests and expansive fields and meadows, past farmland and along the canal, you’ll spot the beautiful ‘Teuten’ homes in Hamont, and then the Bosland ‘Big Five’ a bit further along. And be sure to sample some local artisan cheeses and Trappist Achel – an authentic trappist beer brewed in the Achelse Kluis abbey, right on the Dutch border – along the way. You can also learn about glass in all its various forms in the GlazenHuis in Lommel.

## Start

Achelse Kluis

Since 1998, you can once again taste an authentic Trappist beer in Achel - served straight from the barrel, blond or brown with an alcohol percentage of 5°, this is more of a thirst-quencher for the hiker or cyclist and is only available at the abbey inn. The true beer connoisseur will prefer the Trappist beer available in 33 cl bottles with an alcohol percentage of 8°. It is also available to buy...

The Wire of Death.

The fence has not been forgotten even after more than 100 years. In Hamont-Achel, special signs lead to a reconstruction of this terrifying fence, which for 180 km, from...
