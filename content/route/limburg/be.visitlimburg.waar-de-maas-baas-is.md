## Let's Go!

The Maas is the boss in the east of Limburg! Over the centuries, the river has scoured its way through the beautiful valley, giving nature free rein in several places. The Maas Valley is one of the driest and sunniest regions of Western Europe. The specific soil of gravel and pebbles produces a lot of beauty, from fragrant herbs to graceful vines that, with their roots in the banks of the Maas, transform all the goodness of this unique terroir into distinctive, gourmet products. Taste the Maasland at one of the wine estates along the route or at a sunny outdoor café, cross the river into the Netherlands by ferry, but above all, enjoy kilometres of cycling along endless riverbanks interspersed with cultural highlights.
