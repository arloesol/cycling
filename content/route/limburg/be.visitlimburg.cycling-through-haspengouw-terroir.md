## Let's Go!

Cycle through the undulating fruit landscape of Haspengouw while enjoying impressive panoramas, square farms, quiet church villages, and magnificent castles. The blossoms are on full display in the spring, but there’s possibly even more colour in late summer. Apples and pears are blushing in the orchards. More and more grapevines are popping up on the southern flanks. The Haspengouw Terroir provides some top wines, worth tasting during a stop at a sunny outdoor café. The rich past has left impressive traces here; cultural, industrial, and religious heritage can be seen for miles around, with various works of art in the open spaces in between. It’s probably the most Instagrammable cycling route in Limburg! The colourful hills, the ripening fruit, the fresh wines, and the locals’ thick accents as they tell you about everything around you will spoil all your senses.
