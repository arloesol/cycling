## Let's go !

In terms of size, Leuven doesnâ€™t even come close to the sprawling metropolis of Brussels. But as a cycling destination, this â€˜jewel of the Dyleâ€™ definitely comes highly recommended.

## Practical

On this ride, you can visit the â€˜longest bar in the worldâ€™ (but donâ€™t drink and bike!ðŸ§ƒ), take a break on the banks of the Vaart canal and breathe the fresh air of the natural countryside around Heverlee.
