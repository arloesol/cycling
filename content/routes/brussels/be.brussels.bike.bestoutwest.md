## Let's go !

Call your bestie, set a date and take in the panoramas of the Pajottenland together on a bike ride to Ninove.

## Practical

Stop at poetic hot spots such as the Klapscheut Mill, the Cave of Poelk, the Vineyard Woestijn, the Zeppos Mill or the Watermill at Sint-Gertrudis-Pede. You can find food and drinks aplenty along the way, served at the De Troch Brewery, caf√© Den Haas and caf√© In de Verzekering tegen de Grote Dorst. Imagine yourself in the Tour of Flanders and kick it with your bestie all the way to the finishing line. üö¥
