## The Route

Ready for our next cycling route? This 60-kilometer tour will take you past the Royal Greenhouses of Laeken and the Japanese Towerâ€¦ not to mention the sights to be seen outside of Brussels! ðŸ¤© Follow the canal to Vilvoorde where you can enjoy a picnic by the water at KNP 71. Wind along with the river Zenne until you arrive in Mechelen: city on the Dijle, proud cradle of the multi-award winning Gouden Carolus and home of the ever â€˜soberâ€™ Maneblussers.

The (literal) highlight of your city trip? The St. Rumbold's Cathedral near the Grote Markt! Eager to climb its 538 steps? Just make sure you have energy left for the ride home. ðŸ˜‰

The return route takes you to Grimbergen, where you can taste the abbeyâ€™s delicacies in the Tommenmolen, Liermolen or 's Gravenmolen. Fancy a beer, some cheese or both? Whatever you choose: enjoy (in moderation ðŸ˜‰)!
