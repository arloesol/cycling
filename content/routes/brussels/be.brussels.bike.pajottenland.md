## Let's go !

Want to swap the urban hustle and bustle for some rural peace and quiet with just a few pedal strokes? Anything is possible in Brussels! Go on this cycle tour and be amazed by the untouched natural beauty of the Pajottenland, where you can still admire the landscapes portrayed by Bruegel …

## Practical

Starting from the beautifully restored Vorst abbey, this cycle route will take you past the Anderlecht lakes, Gaasbeek Castle, the Colomapark, Beersel Castle, the Sint-Gertrudis-Pede watermills and the Groenenberg Castle & Domain. Besides enjoying an overwhelming sense of serenity on your way, you’ll also have the option of taking breaks at a number of fantastic stops. Did you know – for example – that St Anna’s Church along your route is depicted in the ‘The Blind Leading the Blind’ by artist Pieter Bruegel? Younger cyclists, in turn, will be thrilled to stop at Het Neerhof children’s farm, while members of the older guard will look forward to a guided tour of the Oude Beersel brewery, one of our country’s last authentic Lambic breweries.
