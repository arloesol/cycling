## Let's go !

Never cycled past Zaventem airport? Then this cycling route to Hofstade is right up your street!

## Practical

Watch the planes land and take off from the spotting platform in Nossegem or Steenokkerzeel, and take a short break in the Hofstade Domain with its ponds and beach. Fancy an extra-speedy ride? Sprint down the Jaagpad along the river Zenne. Be sure to watch out for other bikers and pedestrians though, you courteous cyclist! ðŸ˜‰

Finish your trip with a drink in hand on the Heldenplein (Heroesâ€™ Square) in Zaventem. Did you take this route in the other direction? Then a visit to the Marga Pavilion in Diegem is a must do, too!

Happy biking!
