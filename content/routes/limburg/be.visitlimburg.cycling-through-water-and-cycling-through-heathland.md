## Let's Go ! 

One is never enough! You’ll savour two exceptional cycling experiences in a journey through Central Limburg on this cycling tour. Starting at the C-mine in Genk, we’ll first head for the Hoge Kempen National Park. We’ll enter the park at the Kattevennen Gate. Shady forest trails will lead you to junction 550 via Zutendaal, which is the starting point for ‘Cycling through Heathland’ in the Hoge Kempen National Park, a 4-km route right across the Mechelse Heide. First, you’ll cycle through rugged forests, but then you get heathland that stretches out as far as you can see. Speaking of wide-open views! Climb the observation tower at As Station or the Bliksemtrap in Kattevennen for a wonderful panorama of the National Park and the Limburg mining region. Then set course along the mine rails of Waterschei, Zwartberg, and Winterslag towards Bokrijk. The cycling trail goes right through a pond, from one bank to the other. ‘Cycling through Water’ at junction 91, with the water surface on both sides at eye level. Where can you see such a thing?
