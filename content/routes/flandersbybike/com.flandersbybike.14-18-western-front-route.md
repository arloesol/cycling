## Let's Go ! 

The Western Front Route 14-18 leads a path through the stories of the Great War and where nature and history merge.Â The reality of what took place here is easy to imagine via bunkers and dug-outs, trenches, bomb craters and underground tunnels. The silence and solemnity dominate the many impressive military memorials here.
