## Let's Go ! 

A cycling holiday where mature and culture co-exist with one another as you follow the ‘blue thread’ of the River Scheldt. Cycle along the beautiful and varied terrain taking in breathtaking nature with an abundance of picnic spots to choose from. Or take a break in cities such as Oudenaarde, Ghent or Antwerp. You can even cross the river on ferries.
