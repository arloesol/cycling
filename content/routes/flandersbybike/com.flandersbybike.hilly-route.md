## Let's Go ! 

A challenging ride through the South of Flanders across the hills of different regions such as Voeren, Haspengouw, and the Hageland, to the Flemish Ardennes and Heuvelland. Whether you cycle just part of this route or follow it from the beginning to the very last hill, is up to you.This is a route brimming with historical content and where pit stops allow, try some tasty delicacies such as mattentaart - a regional cheesecake pastry - and enjoy the hospitality of the many brown cafés.
