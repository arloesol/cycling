## Let's Go ! 

The Kempen Route stretches between Antwerp and Maasmechelen and offers plenty of variety. It leads through woods, across expansive stretches of heath, past dunes, the likes of which you might expect in the Sahara, and along the Kempen lakes, as well asÂ  industrial mining heritage along an old coal railway.
