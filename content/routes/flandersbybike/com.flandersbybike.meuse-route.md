## Let's Go ! 

A 63 km-long route along a series of historic villages and endless banks and shores. On the dyke there is not a car in sight, only quaint villages with places to stop, such as the market square of Maaseik and the jewel in the crown of Flemish villages: Oud-Rekem. The River Meuse dominates here with its powerful flow, an energy that few can navigate through!
