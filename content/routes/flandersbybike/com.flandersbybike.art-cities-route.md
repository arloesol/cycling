## Let's Go ! 

Cycle through centuries of Flemish history. The Art Cities Route connects the art cities of Brussels, Leuven, Mechelen, Antwerp, Ghent and Bruges, right to the coast at Ostend, with plenty of nature and flora on the way. You can choose which city you start or end from. And donâ€™t forget to set aside a few days to explore these cities rich in art and culture.
