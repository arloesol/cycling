## Securing the bike

### Registering and Marking the bike

In case the bike is stolen/lost and found - it's useful to have an identifier on the bike so the police/finder can know who is the owner of the bike

Some local police stations organise graving sessions where your National Register number is graved on the bike, you can also register your bike with

- [Velopass](https://velopass.com/en): International Registry (free) - sticker with chip & QR code (5€)
- [Bikebank](https://app.bikebank.be/): Antwerp Registry (free) - sticker (20€)
- [My Bike Brussels](https://mybike.brussels/nl/): Brussels Registry (free) - also get a sticker for free

If your bike is lost/stolen you can check whether it was found by authorities [here](https://gevondenfietsen.be/fiets-zoeken)

### Locking the bike

It is recommended to have 2 locks on the bike

- a horseshoe lock in combination with a chain or schackle lock
  - a horseshoelock with integrated chain just counts as 1 lock - it needs to be an independent chain/schackle lock combined with a horseshoelock
- a chain lock in combination with a schackle lock

A schackle lock is generally safer than a chain lock but it's less practical, you could use the [ART](https://www.stichtingart.nl/#) level to compare safety of locks

You should link the frame and if possible the front wheel to a fixed object, and use the other lock if possible to also lock the frame and the rear wheel. Avoid having the lock close to a flat object (floor) as that would allow for easier cutting of the lock

Put your bike in a place with some social control, and avoid leaving easily removable items on your bike: gps, lights, baggage, ...
